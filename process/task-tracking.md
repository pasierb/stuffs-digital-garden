# â˜‘ Task tracking

I put my ToDos in task tracking system for couple reasons:

1. Obvious one, to not forget what (and when!) I supposed to do.
2. Less obvious, to fight off time wasting on social media. Whenever I have some time to kill I try to go to open task list intead of mindlesly browse YouTube.
3. Reflect on what I achieved. At work it also helps in meetings and to "brag".

## Tool

I use [Notion](../tools/notion.md) database to manage tasks.

What I like about it:

* I already use Notion for [2nd brain](second-brain.md), I like the tool and try to not introduce more if not necessary
* Saved views
* API
* Integrations with other tools, e.g. [Make](../tools/make.md)

## Work

At work I also use "table/database" application to manage tasks - [Google tables](https://support.google.com/area120-tables/answer/10831919).

## Rejected alternatives

* Google Keep
* Google Tasks
* Todoist
* Airtable
