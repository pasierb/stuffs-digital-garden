# Disconnecting from work

## Phone

I'm using [Work profile](https://support.google.com/work/android/answer/6191949?hl=en) feature to separate personal apps from work apps. While it works great, it's easy to fall into "always at work" mode.

Digital wellbeing tools to the rescue. You can set [work profile schedule](https://support.google.com/work/android/answer/7029561?hl=en) to automatically pause work apps.

## Laptop

I use separate laptops for work and for personal things.

Thee are couple reasons why:

* I don't want to see work related emails, notifications after hours.
* It gives me clear separation.
* Corp devices tend to have restrictions on what software You can install on them
* Any work performed on company owned hardware belongs to the company
