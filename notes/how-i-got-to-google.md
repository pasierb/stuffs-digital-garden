# How I got to Google

Landing a SWE job at Google is no easy feat. Being self-taught seemingly hinders one‚Äôs chances, but how about adding to it:

* being thirty-something years old (closer to 40 than 30 üòÖ)
* having wife, small kid and a dog
* being only source of income for family

FAANG interviews are notoriously difficult. Good news is that if I could do it, so can you! Here are some battle-tested tips how to prepare.

## How to study

In my circumstances time I could spent on learning was pretty limited. Full time job, small kid, wife ‚Äì there is not much time and energy left in a day.

I tried to do 8 hours on weekends and fail miserably because kid wants to play (and I want it to!), wife wants to go to IKEA (and I want it to!), dog wants to go for a walk (and‚Ä¶ you guessed it).

I tried late nights after family goes to sleep and failed again. I would do some productive work for first hour and then sit for next 3 staring at the screen not even noticing that I‚Äôm just passing time and depleting myself from sleep.

What changed my approach was to stop thinking about prepping to ‚Äúthe interview‚Äù but rather to be better software engineer. From being goal oriented ‚Äì passing the interview ‚Äì to being **process oriented** ‚Äì being better software engineer.

I would do 30-60 mins daily sessions and that was a game changer. Not only I had more energy for my family, but it also learned at higher pace. Having shorter sessions allowed me digest the material better, think about it throughout the day and make it stick to brain‚Äôs long-term memory.

## Know your basics

Think about it as your tools. You need to have them handy and know how to use them. In 30-40 mins that you have to solve a problem(s) there is no time to figure out how BFS, DFS, works ‚Äì you HAVE TO have this knowledge available to you at will.

Must know topics IMO in no particular order:

### Data structures:

* Linked lists
* Arrays
* Maps
* Sets
* Trees / Graphs / Tries (this tend to very useful)
* Heaps

### Algorithms

* basic sorting algorithms
* Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm ‚Äì a lot of interview problems are some sort of variations
* backtracking
* dynamic programming
* tree traversal (DFS, BFS)

## Practice

I distinguish two phases of practice:

1. Basics
2. Problem solving

### Basics

For basics there is not other way that just writing code. Once you understand basic concepts you need to be fluent in transcribing those ideas to code. Don‚Äôt memorise implementation, understand well enough that you can implement it without effort.

The goal is to build ready to use mental blocks. If part of the problem is to traverse a tree you could say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to use breath-first-search, it‚Äôs going to be O(n) time complexity‚Äù and focus on next part of the challenge.

You need to be ready to talk about details of implementation, but chances are that you won‚Äôt need to write it down.

### Problem solving

This might be a bit controversial, but I believe that you either know the solution or not. There is to little time to figure it out on the spot. This is where purposeful learning comes to play.

Start with easy problems, get comfortable. When it‚Äôs getting to comfortable start moving to medium difficulty. Up the ante enough to keep you engaged but not discouraged. If you‚Äôre stuck for more than 15 minutes, then just read the solution ‚Äì that‚Äôs how you learn!

Once you‚Äôre fairly comfortable with coding up the solutions‚Ä¶ stop coding. Solve it in your head and check answers in forums to verify. My rule of thumb was no more than 10 minutes per question. Again, if you can‚Äôt solve it just lookup the solution, try to understand it and move on ‚Äì chances are you will encounter this question again.

This approach should develop in You some intuition what data structures to use, what kind of algorithm problem lends itself to. You will rather not encounter the same question in the interview, but it might be similar.

## During interview

### Think out loud

Your thinking process matters. Your interviewer can‚Äôt read your mind, read it to her. If you considering array, say it. If it‚Äôs something You discard, explain why. This also allows your interviewer to push you in the right direction.

One thing to pay attention to is rambling. If you notice that your thoughts are chaotic and you interviewer is confused, stop for a second. Say that you need a minute to think and relax.

### Explain your approach

Before You start writing code you have to have clear picture how to arrive at solution. Write down your algorithms in plain words and discuss it with your interviewer. I always ask directly ‚Äúshall we proceed to coding?‚Äù. Most interviewers will signal to you if she has some concerns and you should correct your approach first.

### Use helper functions

Focus on high level solution first using helper functions and fill them out later. For example: if you have algorithms that need topological sort, just write it as you would have it ‚Äì \`topologicalSort(items)\` ‚Äì and tell your interviewer that you will implement it later. Here it‚Äôs important that you know your basics and can identify time/space complexity for those helpers so interviewer feels confident that you know how to implement it.

It is possible that interviewer will get enough signals and you won‚Äôt have to fill in those helper functions. The key point here is to have complete algorithm in time. Chances are that there is a follow up question and your helpers become irrelevant anyways.

## Just try!

Let‚Äôs face it, chances that you will nail it in first try are slim. Why not get some practice then? Apply early and see where you stand. Don‚Äôt get me wrong ‚Äì try your best, prepare like your life depends on it, but keep in mind that it may not be your last time applying üòâ I applied to all FAANG companies and others known to have similar interview process, just to get some reps in. Even if you apply to company that is not you first choice you might ended up getting hard to reject offer (BTW that‚Äôs how I ended up at Amazon in Berlin).

There is a lot of stress involved and you will forget about details so take notes about the process:

* what questions were you asked
* what worked and what not
* what areas to focus next time

It will come handy next time, trust me.

## Final thoughts

It‚Äôs not easy, but it‚Äôs doable. Treat it as a marathon, not a sprint. If you think about the whole thing as a means to become better software engineer, with a possible side effect of landing your dream job it will become easier and pay dividends in your career regardless of the outcome.
