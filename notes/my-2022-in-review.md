# My 2022 in Review

2022 was eventful to say the least. I just started my dream job at Google (11.2021) and after 2 years in Berlin I moved back to Switzerland. Despite sucessful carrer I had probably the worst year mentally. Good news is that I close this year with a lot of the problems behind me.

Here is my 2022 sprint retrospective.

## What helped me forward?

### Building second brain

In 2021 and throught first half of 2022 I was in a slump. Not only I was not delivering as I used to, but I really felt like I'm lagging behind in terms of understanding the problems as I was put against to solve. The sheer amount of new information, concepts, background knowledge I had to abosorb was beyond me, or so I thought at the time. That feeling of "not knowing", "I read about it somewhere, but I can't remember where" had a mental toll on me.

[Building a Second Brain](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59616977-building-a-second-brain?ref=nav\_sb\_ss\_1\_12) by Tiago Forte came to the rescue. Turns out it's not only my problem, human brains are not really designed to do software engineering, to solve abstract business problems nor to store large amounts of information that may not be crucial for survivor.

### Craftsman mentality

I was veeery lucky throughout my professional carrer to rarely had work on something I would not be passionate about. When moving to Amazon (and later to Google) I kind of knew that this was most probably going to change ðŸ˜….

Cal Newport's [So Good They Can't Ignore You](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13525945-so-good-they-can-t-ignore-you) opened my eyes on the importance of (or rather lack there of) of passion at work and that it comes from being good at something - not the other way around. I've deliberately put away thoughts about having passion to work and switched my mindset to "creaftsman mentality". Not only I became happier, less stressed, restored work-life balance but also started to enjoy my work again.

## What held me back?

### Time wasters

YouTube. Plain and simple. The amount of time I wasted watching brain-dead videos is really embarrasing.

I let myself go with a lot of bad habbits coming back to my daily routine with social media consumption on top of the list. Couple years ago I had simmiliar problem and [Atomic Habits](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits?ref=nav\_sb\_ss\_1\_8) helped my out. First step to fix the problem is to recognise it, for 2023 I plan to replace social media with something more useful like learning German.

### Physical fitness

I blame lockdown, desk job, Google diet, lack of time... and me.

In 2023 I will turn 40 years old ðŸ¤¯, getting back to shape is on my top #3 priorities. I used to be very active and competitive, playing basketball in 2nd league in Switzerland, taking part in squash club leagues, lifting weights. Somehow in the pursuit of carrer I put all of those on hold - big mistake! It's so much more difficult to get back in shape than to keep it.

## Summary

If I had to grade my 2022 I would give it solid 4 out of 5. It was difficult, challenging, uncomfortable... but I pulled through and it feels so good to overcome obstacles life is throwing at You. Bring it on, 2023!
