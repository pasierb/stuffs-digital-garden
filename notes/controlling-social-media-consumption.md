# Controlling social media consumption

## Context

My media consumption went out of hand.

* Most of everyday tasks starts with "let me just pick something to listen on YouTube".
* Casual visits to the loo end up lasting 10 mins.
* Bedtime routine always involves phone
* Work starts with YouTube
* ...and probably more than I don't even notice anymore.

## Control measures

### Phone usage limits

Android has a [Digital Wellbeing](https://www.android.com/digital-wellbeing/) features built in. I use it to:

* Limit time for [apps](https://support.google.com/android/answer/9346420?hl=en#zippy=%2Climit-how-much-time-you-spend-on-a-website-each-day%2Climit-how-much-time-you-spend-in-an-app-each-day), like Twitter
* Limit time for [specific websites](https://support.google.com/android/answer/9346420?hl=en#zippy=%2Climit-how-much-time-you-spend-in-an-app-each-day%2Climit-how-much-time-you-spend-on-a-website-each-day), like Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram

### Make bad habbits painful

I used Brave browser for YouTube as it blocks adds. I Removed it to make YouTube more painfull. I hope that when I encounter lengthy add I will recognize bad habbit and go back to be productive.

### Limit distractions

[Focus mode](https://blog.google/products/android/android-focus-mode/) allows to pause apps for a specific time or in a schedule. It's one step more to stop You from distracting.

Disabling [notifications](https://support.google.com/android/answer/9079661?hl=en) from certain apps also helps a lot.
