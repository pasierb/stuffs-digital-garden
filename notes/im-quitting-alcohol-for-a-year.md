# I'm quitting alcohol for a year

This is one of those "hold me accountable" posts. I want to see in 12 months how great of a decission it was / how delusional and naive I was - yet to be decided on the outcome.

Here's why I decided to do it and what I expect out of it.

## Context

I'm Polish - we have a reputation to be good drinkers and by "good" I mean that we can drink a lot. It's part of our culture to celebrate with a bottle of vodka, our weddings are famous to last 2 days and be a marathon "drink, eat, dance" cycles, at some point of a christmass eve dinner a bottle meterialises on the table. Alcohol is ever present part of our lifes.

## Motivation

### Break the peer pressure

This context is one of the reasons. I enjoy drinking ocasionally but often find myself coerced into a drink just because I'm expected to drink. I want to be in control of my actions. I expect some awkward social situations to come out of it, e.g. "What? You won't drink with me?!" (it's a well known polish meme)

### Show myself that I can

What a great feeling it is to sit comfortably on the couch after long day at work with a bottle of cold beer in hand and some good game on the TV...

Well, that's the point. It is great and... easy. I had my fair share of easy in life, now I want to see if I can resist easy pleasures and maybe go for something less obvious.

### Physical health

I'm turning 40 this year. Last 2 years I was doing very little to improve my fitness and getting back to shape is getting much more painful now comparing to when I was 30 ðŸ¥². In the past I managed to built some good habbits and I feel this is the time to build some more regarding my healthy lifestyle. Lately one good party is able to take me out for a good day or two out of my rythm.

## Expected results

I'm very curious about effects of this challange. Obviously I already have in mind some outcomes, but what interest me the most is how wrong I am ðŸ˜….

I expect that direct (and indirect) effects of not drinking for a year will include:

1. Visible body fat loss
2. Some relationships deteriorating
3. Having to explain why I'm doing to the same people this over and over again
4. Being mocked/laughed at
5. Avoiding parties when alcohol is expected
6. New hobby
7. Reading more books
8. Turning to sports more

## Conclusion

I hope that on 26.12.2023 - my birthday - I will open a cold beer (or maybe I will find better way to celebrate until then) and sit down to write a lengthy post announcing my great success. Maybe this will be a life changing decission... or a total defeat.

I'll end with hopefully not self-fulfilling joke:

> I was on a diet for 2 months. Do You know how much I lost?! I lost 60 days!
