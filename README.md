## About me

My name is Micha≈Ç (pronounced "me-how"[^1]) Pasierbski.&#x20;

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/me-wheel-web (1).jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

I'm a software engineer (currently at Google). I work with web technologies for over 10 years now - still remember discussions whether to use jQuery or Prototype, CoffeeScript and Ruby on Rails as a new kid on the block üë¥.

I live in beautiful Switzerland where the buffer zone between high density residential area and cow pasture can be a narrow, local road üòç

    "how" like "how are you"
